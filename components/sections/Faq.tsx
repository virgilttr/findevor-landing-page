      question: "Can I pause or cancel my subscription anytime?",
      answer:
        "You can pause or cancel your subscription anytime in 2-clicks.  We understand that you may not always have enough design work to fill up the entire month.  In that case, pausing your subscription is the perfect option for you. You'll be able to use your remaining days when you'll have more design work to be done. ",

      question: "What is the workflow?",
      answer:
        "We use Trello as request system. Simply make a request in Trello and let us manage the rest.  We like to keep the communication effective with tools like Slack, Teams or Loom.  The design will be done in Figma. There, you'll be able to view, comment and approve the designs.  If you are lost with those tools, don't worry we'll set you up in minutes. ",
